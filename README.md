# Flyweight Pattern Implementation
This project showcases an implementation of the Flyweight Design Pattern as part of a school assignment for IMT Atlantique. The Flyweight Pattern is used to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much data as possible with related objects.

## Getting Started
To compile and run the project, follow these steps:

## Compile the Project:

### Open a terminal in the project's root directory.
Run make to compile the project. This will generate the executable in the bin directory.
```sh
make
```
### Run the Application:

After compilation, you can run the executable forest_sim:
```sh
bin/forest_sim
```
### Generate and View Graphs:

The application generates data that can be visualized with plotGraph.py. Run the Python script to view the graphs:
```sh
python plotGraph.py
```
## Project Structure
**src/:** Contains all source files (.cpp) and header files (.h) for the project.

**bin/:** Contains the executable file forest_sim after compilation.

**obj/:** Contains intermediate object files (.o) generated during compilation.

**plotGraph.py:** Python script for plotting and visualizing data generated by the application.
